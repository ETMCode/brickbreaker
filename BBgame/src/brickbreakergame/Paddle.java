//the guidlines for what happens with the keyboard (we can use it for bricks if we wanted/will talk in class) *powerups??!?*
//I think keystroke is already imported could be wrong though

//This is one of two paddles and Paddle class may change to Paddle1 *4/13/26
//Theres 2 ways to do this either if statements or utilizing the keystroke command which is tied to the Jframe
// Scannner Keys1 = new Scanner(System.in); (was going to use this but requires ENTER after every input so no go)

 //VK stands for virtual key! Its much easier to call then getting the hexcode number and when I add a second paddle I can use VK to call the arrow keys as oppsed to finding their respective hexnumber 
 //Was going to use arrow keys at first but for now just want to test this all with A and D to make it easier (*can change ASAP if needed*)


  //add hold down button options
  if (button == KeyEvent.VK_A) { x = x -1; }
 //moves paddle1 to the left (change -1 if we want to increase the space it moves)
  if (button == KeyEvent.VK_D) { x = x +1; }

 //Thses two are required becasue of the Keylistner tool (its dumb but it wont run without them)
  
//[TODO] 
//Create a second paddle on the inverse so like -
//Ask if we want paddle to be able to turn (tilt on an axis)
//If Brick or Bricks wants to add effects that could invert paddles control code (ie: make it use VK_W or VK_S when (blankbrick) hit)
//Move ball collison to paddle folder  
//Need setters and getters 
//If keys calls goes to me then goes to him then back to me?
